# MLOps Project: Hate Speech Detection API

This project demonstrates a complete MLOps workflow for building, improving, and containerizing a machine learning model. The goal is to detect hate speech in text and serve the model via a robust FastAPI.

## Key Achievements
* **Data Analysis**: Performed exploratory data analysis on an imbalanced dataset, identifying the need for resampling.
* **Model Improvement**: Successfully addressed class imbalance using **SMOTE** to significantly improve hate speech detection recall from **17% to 54%**.
* **API Development**: Created a RESTful API with **FastAPI** to serve the model predictions.
* **Containerization**: Packaged the entire application in a **Docker container** for portability and deployment.

## Technologies
* **Python**
* **Scikit-learn**
* **FastAPI**
* **Docker**
